# DocEye
DocEye is an advanced FastAPI project built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately distinguish between faces and signatures in uploaded images. 
This powerful API enables seamless integration into various applications and systems, providing efficient document analysis and verification capabilities.

DocEye: Face and Signature Recognition API

# Key Features:
* FastAPI framework for high-performance API handling and scalability.
* Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate image classification.
* Supports image upload for real-time processing and analysis.
* Provides detailed classification results for faces and signatures.
* Easy integration with existing systems and applications.

# How It Works:
* Upload an image containing a face or a signature using the API endpoint.
* DocEye preprocesses the image and extracts relevant features.
* The CNN model performs advanced analysis and classifies the image as a face or a signature.
* The API responds with the prediction, indicating whether the image contains a face or a signature.


# Benefits:
* Accurately differentiate between faces and signatures in uploaded images.
* Streamline document processing workflows with automated image classification.
* Enhance document analysis and verification processes with advanced machine learning techniques.
* Seamlessly integrate the DocEye API into your applications or systems.
* Improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance document management tasks.
